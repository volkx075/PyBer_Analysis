# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose
V. Isualize is asking Omar and I to generate a DataFrame showing the ride-sharing data by city type. Then they want us to calculate the weekly fares for each city type. From these calculations, V. Isualize requests a line graph that shows the weekly fares by each city type from January 2019 through April 2019. Lasltly, they want a written report of our results and how PyBer should address the differences between city types.
